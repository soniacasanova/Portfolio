            <p className="container-text">Hello, I'm Sonia â€“ a dedicated Front End Developer and UX/UI Designer from the vibrant streets of Barcelona, with a passion for solving problems and continuous learning. With a background in design, I embarked on a transformative adventure in Norway, where I hunt through into the world of coding, teaching myself the intricacies of web development. 
                <br></br><br></br>Returning to my roots, I immersed myself in the dynamic realm of digital marketing, crafting seamless digital experiences that bridge the gap between design and functionality. My curiosity knew no bounds, leading me to pursue a Full Stack Development postgrad, broadening my skills even further. Recently, I completed a Master's in Project Management, adding a strategic dimension to my expertise.<br></br><br></br>
                When I am not immersed in the digital realm, I find inspiration in my love for traveling, the rhythm of music, captivating series, and the energy I gain from staying fit. Join me on this creative journey, where innovation meets ambition and every project is an opportunity to learn and grow.
